This project is a remake of my Java 2D planetary orbit simulator using C++ and the [olcPixelGameEngine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine)

# Features
- Force applied physics
  - Each planet applies forces to each other planet depending on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?F&space;=&space;\frac{GMm}{r^{2}}" title="F = \frac{GMm}{r^{2}}" />
  - Can drag planets using force vector
- Camera
  - WASD camera
  - Zooming in and out
  - Lock camera to planet

- Graphical
 - 2D pixel graphics
 - GUI to display data usch as velocity and mass of selected planet
 - Drawing planet trails of previous positions
 - Drawing velocity vectors.
